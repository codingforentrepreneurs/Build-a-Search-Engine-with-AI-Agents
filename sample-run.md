## Sample Queries

These queries demonstrate hybrid search strengths - combining exact keyword matching with semantic understanding.

### Semantic Understanding (finds related concepts with different words)

```bash
# Should find: meditation, mindfulness, yoga, sleep, CBT
tars search "how to calm my mind"

# Should find: steak recipes, cooking techniques
tars search "cooking meat perfectly"

# Should find: running, climbing, yoga, hiking
tars search "getting in better shape"

# Should find: investing, retirement, index funds
tars search "growing my savings"

# Should find: language learning, immersion, Duolingo
tars search "picking up a new language"

# Should find: stoicism, mindfulness, CBT, Kierkegaard
tars search "dealing with life's challenges"

# Should find: writing, worldbuilding, story structure
tars search "crafting compelling stories"

# Should find: coffee, espresso, pour over
tars search "making better morning drinks"
```

### Cross-Domain Discovery (finds unexpected connections)

```bash
# Should find: music production + writing + photography (all creative)
tars search "creative hobbies to learn"

# Should find: permaculture + sustainable architecture + climate
tars search "living more sustainably"

# Should find: GTD + Zettelkasten + atomic habits + Roam
tars search "organizing my life better"

# Should find: startups + investing + sales + economics
tars search "building wealth"

# Should find: neural networks + quantum computing + algorithms
tars search "cutting edge computing"

# Should find: ancient history + philosophy + democracy
tars search "foundations of western civilization"

# Should find: astronomy + exoplanets + JWST + black holes
tars search "what's out there in space"
```

### Keyword Precision (exact terms matter)

```bash
# Should rank PostgreSQL docs highest
tars search "PostgreSQL tutorial"

# Should find React specifically, then other frameworks
tars search "React hooks guide"

# Should find TimescaleDB specifically
tars search "TimescaleDB hypertables"

# Should find the specific game
tars search "Baldur's Gate 3"

# Should find reverse sear steak
tars search "reverse sear steak temperature"

# Should find JWST article
tars search "James Webb telescope discoveries"
```

### Hybrid Power (keyword + semantic together)

```bash
# "python" keyword + "learning" semantic understanding
tars search "python machine learning tutorial"

# "espresso" keyword + brewing concepts
tars search "espresso extraction techniques"

# "minimalist" keyword + lifestyle concepts
tars search "minimalist lifestyle design"

# "stoic" keyword + practical application
tars search "stoic philosophy daily practice"

# "WWII" keyword + broader historical context
tars search "WWII impact on modern world"

# "sourdough" keyword + baking science
tars search "sourdough fermentation science"
```

### Natural Questions (conversational queries)

```bash
tars search "what should I invest in for retirement"
tars search "how do I train my dog"
tars search "why is sleep important"
tars search "what causes inflation"
tars search "how to take better photos"
tars search "where should I travel in Asia"
tars search "what is the best way to learn programming"
tars search "how do black holes work"
```

### Conceptual Queries (abstract ideas)

```bash
tars search "understanding human motivation"
tars search "the nature of consciousness"
tars search "building good habits"
tars search "finding meaning in work"
tars search "creativity and innovation"
tars search "systems thinking"
```

### Compare Hybrid vs Individual Methods

```bash
# Run all three to see the difference:
tars search "neural network training"           # hybrid
tars text_search "neural network training"      # keyword only (BM25)
tars vector "neural network training"           # semantic only

tars search "feeling anxious and overwhelmed"   # hybrid
tars text_search "feeling anxious and overwhelmed"  # keyword only
tars vector "feeling anxious and overwhelmed"   # semantic only
```

## Expected Hybrid Search Advantages

1. **Synonym handling**: "car" finds "automobile", "vehicle", "EV"
2. **Concept clustering**: "relaxation" finds yoga, meditation, sleep
3. **Cross-domain**: "learning" finds language, music, programming, cooking
4. **Specificity when needed**: "PostgreSQL" still ranks exact matches high
5. **Natural language**: "how do I..." queries work naturally
6. **Typo tolerance**: semantic search compensates for slight mismatches
7. **Context awareness**: "python" in programming context vs snake context
